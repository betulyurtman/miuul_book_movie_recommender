This project has been prepared for Miuul Data Scientist and Machine Learning final project. Our project was selected as one of the 7 projects for final presentations.

The main focus of this project was to prepare a website to recommend books and movies to both individuals and groups. Also, we mixed things by recommending books for movie chosen and also the opposite version!

For this project we used two datasets, one for books and one for the movies. We focused on both the descriptions and ratings, and our algorithm was focused on finding the most similar recommendations while considering the ratings.
